        Monstera deliciosa, also known as the Swiss Cheese Plant, is a popular houseplant known for its distinctive split leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Water when the top inch of soil feels dry, typically every 1-2 weeks. This plant loves humidity and benefits from regular misting. During growing season (spring and summer), feed monthly with a balanced liquid fertilizer. Monstera can grow quite large indoors, reaching 6-8 feet tall. Support with a moss pole for best results. Common problems include yellowing leaves (overwatering) and brown leaf tips (low humidity or fluoride in water).

        Snake plants are perfect for beginners due to their low maintenance requirements. They tolerate low light conditions but prefer bright, indirect light. Water sparingly - only when soil is completely dry, usually every 2-3 weeks in growing season and less in winter. Overwatering is the most common cause of death. Use well-draining cactus soil mix. Snake plants are extremely drought tolerant and can survive weeks without water. They prefer temperatures between 70-90¬∞F and low humidity. Fertilize monthly during spring and summer with diluted liquid fertilizer. Common varieties include Sansevieria trifasciata and Sansevieria cylindrica.

        Fiddle leaf figs are notorious for being finicky, but understanding their needs helps. Brown spots usually indicate overwatering or bacterial infection - reduce watering and ensure good drainage. Yellowing leaves often mean underwatering or natural leaf drop. Dropping leaves suddenly usually indicates stress from changes in light, temperature, or watering schedule. These plants need bright, indirect light and consistent care. Water when top 1-2 inches of soil are dry. They prefer humidity around 40-50% and temperatures between 65-75¬∞F. Rotate weekly for even growth and dust leaves regularly for optimal photosynthesis.

        Winter care for succulents requires significant adjustments. Reduce watering frequency dramatically - most succulents enter dormancy and need water only every 3-4 weeks. Move plants to the brightest available location as daylight hours decrease. Maintain temperatures above 50¬∞F for most species. Stop fertilizing completely during winter months. Watch for etiolation (stretching) due to insufficient light - consider grow lights if needed. Many succulents like Echeveria and Sedum can handle temperatures down to 40¬∞F but should be protected from frost. Resume normal care gradually in spring.

Scale insects appear as brown bumps on stems - scrape off and treat with neem oil. Prevention is key: quarantine new plants, inspect regularly, maintain proper humidity, and avoid overwatering.

        Plant propagation is an exciting way to expand your collection for free. Water propagation works well for pothos, philodendrons, and many tropical plants - cut below a node and place in water until roots develop. Leaf propagation is perfect for succulents - let cut leaves callus for 2-3 days, then place on soil and mist lightly. Division works for plants with multiple crowns like snake plants and ZZ plants - carefully separate root systems and pot separately. Stem cuttings work for most houseplants - cut 4-6 inch pieces with nodes and either root in water or directly in soil. Spring and summer are the best times for propagation when plants are actively growing.
