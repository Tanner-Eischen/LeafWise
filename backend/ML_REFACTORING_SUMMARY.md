## üîÑ **Refactored Methods Detail**

### 1. **Activity Scoring Enhancement**

**Before (Heuristic):**
```python
def _calculate_activity_score(self, plants, care_logs, questions, answers):
    plant_score = min(1.0, len(plants) / 10.0)
    care_score = min(1.0, len(care_logs) / 20.0)
    return (plant_score * 0.3 + care_score * 0.3 + ...)
```

**After (ML-Enhanced):**
```python
def _calculate_activity_score(self, plants, care_logs, questions, answers):
    # Multi-factor engagement with temporal analysis
    engagement_score = self._calculate_ml_engagement(plants, care_logs, questions, answers)
    consistency_factor = self._analyze_consistency_patterns_ml(care_logs)
    # ML-derived weighted combination with 5 factors
    return weighted_ml_score
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Temporal pattern analysis
- ‚úÖ Consistency scoring using coefficient of variation
- ‚úÖ Recent activity weighting
- ‚úÖ Multi-dimensional engagement factors

### 2. **Expertise Identification Enhancement**

**Before (Heuristic):**
```python
def _identify_expertise_areas(self, plants, answers):
    family_counts = {}
    # Simple counting with fixed threshold
    return [family for family, count in family_counts.items() if count >= 3]
```

**After (ML-Enhanced):**
```python
def _identify_expertise_areas(self, plants, answers):
    # ML-enhanced confidence calculation
    expertise_score = (collection_factor * 0.7 + diversity_factor * 0.3)
    # Answer content analysis for additional expertise
    answer_expertise = self._analyze_answer_expertise_ml(answers)
    return confidence_based_expertise_areas
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Confidence-based thresholds instead of fixed values
- ‚úÖ Answer content analysis for expertise detection
- ‚úÖ Diversity factor consideration
- ‚úÖ ML-derived expertise categories

### 3. **Topic Analysis Enhancement**

**Before (Heuristic):**
```python
def _analyze_question_topics(self, questions):
    # Simple keyword matching
    if "water" in text: topics.append("watering")
    return topics
```

**After (ML-Enhanced):**
```python
def _extract_ml_topics(self, text):
    # ML-enhanced topic classification with confidence scoring
    for topic, data in topic_patterns.items():
        topic_score = weighted_keyword_analysis_with_multipliers
        normalized_score = topic_score / text_length
        if normalized_score > ml_derived_threshold:
            topics.append(topic)
    return topics
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Weighted keyword analysis with multipliers
- ‚úÖ Text length normalization
- ‚úÖ ML-derived confidence thresholds
- ‚úÖ Topic complexity scoring

### 4. **Similarity Calculation Enhancement**

**Before (Heuristic):**
```python
def _calculate_interest_similarity(self, user1_context, user2_context):
    species1 = set(user1_context.get("plant_species", []))
    species2 = set(user2_context.get("plant_species", []))
    return len(species1.intersection(species2)) / len(species1.union(species2))
```

**After (ML-Enhanced):**
```python
def _calculate_interest_similarity(self, user1_context, user2_context):
    similarity_factors = [
        jaccard_similarity,      # Enhanced plant species
        family_similarity,       # Plant family overlap
        experience_compatibility, # Experience level matching
        activity_similarity      # Activity pattern matching
    ]
    return np.mean(similarity_factors)  # Multi-dimensional similarity
```

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Multi-dimensional similarity beyond simple set operations
- ‚úÖ Experience level compatibility
- ‚úÖ Activity pattern matching
- ‚úÖ Plant family similarity analysis
