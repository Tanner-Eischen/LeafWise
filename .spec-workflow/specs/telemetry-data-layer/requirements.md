# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The telemetry data layer provides comprehensive data management capabilities for the LeafWise plant monitoring system. This feature encompasses four critical components: telemetry providers/repositories for API communication, state management for real-time data handling, API integration to replace placeholder TODOs in existing screens, and offline data persistence using the sync service architecture. The purpose is to transform the current UI prototype into a fully functional telemetry system that can collect, store, synchronize, and display plant monitoring data reliably across online and offline scenarios.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports LeafWise's core mission of providing intelligent plant monitoring by establishing the foundational data infrastructure. It enables real-time data collection from sensors, persistent storage for historical analysis, and seamless synchronization across devices. The telemetry data layer is essential for delivering accurate plant health insights and supporting the AI-driven recommendations that define the LeafWise experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a plant owner, I want my light readings and growth photos to be automatically saved and synchronized, so that I can track my plant's progress over time without losing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a light measurement is taken THEN the system SHALL save the reading to local storage immediately
2. WHEN a growth photo is captured THEN the system SHALL save the photo and metadata to local storage immediately
3. WHEN network connectivity is available THEN the system SHALL automatically sync all pending data to the backend
4. IF network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue to store data locally without data loss
5. WHEN the app is reopened THEN the system SHALL display all previously collected data from local storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a plant owner, I want to view my telemetry history with real data instead of mock data, so that I can make informed decisions about my plant care.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the telemetry history screen THEN the system SHALL load and display actual light readings from storage
2. WHEN I view growth photos THEN the system SHALL display actual captured photos with their timestamps
3. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. IF no data exists THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with guidance to start collecting data
5. WHEN new data is collected THEN the telemetry history SHALL automatically update to reflect the latest information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a plant owner, I want the light measurement and photo capture screens to work with real data persistence, so that my measurements are not lost when I navigate away from the screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete a light measurement THEN the system SHALL save the reading and navigate back with confirmation
2. WHEN I capture a growth photo THEN the system SHALL process and save the photo with metadata
3. WHEN I navigate away during data saving THEN the system SHALL complete the save operation in the background
4. IF an error occurs during saving THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry
5. WHEN data is successfully saved THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation to the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and maintainable data layer architecture, so that the telemetry system can be easily extended and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing providers THEN the system SHALL follow repository pattern with clear interfaces
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use consistent state management patterns across all telemetry features
3. WHEN integrating APIs THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide appropriate user feedback
4. IF API calls fail THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry when connectivity is restored
5. WHEN adding new telemetry data types THEN the system SHALL support extension without breaking existing functionality

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each provider, repository, and state manager should handle one specific aspect of telemetry data
- **Modular Design**: Telemetry components should be isolated and reusable across different parts of the application
- **Dependency Management**: Clear separation between data layer, business logic, and presentation layers
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined contracts between providers, repositories, and state management components

### Performance
- Data operations should complete within 2 seconds for normal network conditions
- Local data access should be instantaneous (< 100ms)
- Image processing and storage should not block the UI thread
- Background sync should not impact foreground app performance

### Security
- All API communications must use secure HTTPS connections
- Sensitive data should be encrypted in local storage
- API keys and authentication tokens must be securely managed
- User data should never be logged or exposed in error messages

### Reliability
- System must handle network interruptions gracefully
- Data integrity must be maintained during sync operations
- Failed operations must be retryable without data corruption
- System should recover gracefully from unexpected shutdowns

### Usability
- Loading states should be clear and informative
- Error messages should be user-friendly and actionable
- Data sync should happen transparently in the background
- Users should receive confirmation when data is successfully saved
