# Sensor & Photo Telemetry - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Sensor & Photo Telemetry feature aims to enhance plant care by providing users with accurate light intensity measurements and passive growth tracking capabilities. This document outlines the requirements for implementing this feature in the LeafWise application.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature directly supports LeafWise's mission to provide data-driven plant care by:
- Enabling precise environmental monitoring through light measurements
- Facilitating growth tracking through periodic photo analysis
- Supporting the Context-Aware Care Plans feature with light reading data
- Empowering users with objective measurements for optimal plant care

## Requirements

### 1. Light Intensity Measurement

**Description:** The system shall provide multiple methods for measuring light intensity (lux) and converting to Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) estimates.

**Details:**
- Support three measurement sources: Ambient Light Sensor (ALS), Camera, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices
- Implement calibration mechanisms to improve accuracy
- Associate readings with specific plants and/or location tags
- Store light source profiles (sun, white_led, other) for accurate PPFD conversion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Camera reading variance ≤ 20% vs calibration reference after wizard
- BLE reads ≥ 1Hz stable for supported sensors

### 2. Growth Tracking via Photos

**Description:** The system shall enable passive growth tracking through periodic photos of plants.

**Details:**
- Implement photo capture and storage workflow
- Extract basic metrics from photos (leaf area, height)
- Support offline queue for photo uploads
- Associate photos with specific plants

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Growth photo upload handles offline queue with retry/backoff
- Basic metrics extraction works for common plant types

### 3. Data Storage and Management

**Description:** The system shall store and manage telemetry data efficiently.

**Details:**
- Implement database tables for light readings and growth photos
- Support efficient querying by plant, time range, and location
- Implement proper data retention policies

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Database queries for telemetry data complete within 300ms (P95)
- Storage requirements scale linearly with user base

### 4. API Implementation

**Description:** The system shall provide RESTful APIs for telemetry data submission and retrieval.

**Details:**
- Implement endpoints for light readings (single and batch)
- Implement endpoints for growth photo upload and retrieval
- Support filtering and pagination for data retrieval

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All API endpoints conform to OpenAPI specification
- Endpoints handle error cases gracefully with appropriate status codes

### 5. Client Module Implementation

**Description:** The system shall provide client-side modules for telemetry collection.

**Details:**
- Implement `light_meter` module with multiple measurement strategies
- Implement `growth_tracker` module for photo capture and processing
- Design modules with pure interfaces and adapter pattern for side effects

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Modules function correctly across supported device types
- Implementation follows clean architecture principles

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture
- Follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- Implement pure functions for domain logic with adapters for side effects
- Use typed DTOs and boundary adapters

### Performance
- Light reading capture completes within 1 second
- API response times under 300ms (P95)
- Minimal battery impact from background operations

### Security
- All data transmission uses TLS
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Ensure user data privacy

### Reliability
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Support offline operation with synchronization
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

### Usability
- Provide clear feedback during measurement processes
- Implement intuitive UI for viewing telemetry data
- Support accessibility features

## Metrics
- `telemetry.light.samples`: Count of light readings collected
- `telemetry.light.ppfd.estimate_error`: Error rate in PPFD estimation
- `telemetry.growth.upload_fail_ratio`: Ratio of failed growth photo uploads
