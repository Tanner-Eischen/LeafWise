# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Phase 1 Foundation establishes the core infrastructure and essential features for the LeafWise application. This phase focuses on setting up the project structure, implementing camera integration, AI plant identification, user authentication, user profiles, and plant collection functionality. These foundational elements will serve as the building blocks for subsequent phases of development.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This phase directly supports the product vision outlined in the steering documents by delivering the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features necessary for plant identification and user engagement. It aligns with the Phase 1 Foundation goals in the product strategy, which emphasizes establishing core plant identification and user profiles. By implementing these features, we create the foundation for the social and AI enhancement features planned for future phases.

## Requirements

### Project Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure following the guidelines in the structure.md document, so that the codebase is maintainable, scalable, and follows AI-first development principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL follow the directory structure outlined in structure.md
2. WHEN creating new files THEN the system SHALL adhere to the naming conventions specified in structure.md
3. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL organize code according to the feature module structure defined in structure.md

### Camera Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to take high-quality photos of plants using my device camera, so that I can identify them accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL request camera permissions
2. WHEN the user accesses the camera feature THEN the system SHALL provide a camera interface optimized for plant photography
3. WHEN the user takes a photo THEN the system SHALL provide options to retake, crop, or proceed with identification
4. WHEN the user is in low-light conditions THEN the system SHALL suggest using flash or provide guidance for better photos

### AI Plant Identification

**User Story:** As a user, I want to identify plants by taking their photo, so that I can learn about unknown plants I encounter.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a plant photo THEN the system SHALL process the image and return identification results
2. WHEN identification is complete THEN the system SHALL display the plant name, confidence score, and basic information
3. WHEN multiple potential matches exist THEN the system SHALL present alternatives with confidence levels
4. WHEN the system cannot identify a plant THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and suggestions for better photos

### User Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create an account and securely log in, so that I can access my personal plant collection across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create a secure account with email verification
2. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials securely
3. WHEN a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide a secure password reset process
4. WHEN a user is inactive for an extended period THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### User Profiles

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage my profile, so that I can personalize my experience and prepare for social features in future phases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL create a basic profile with customizable fields
2. WHEN a user edits their profile THEN the system SHALL update the information across the application
3. WHEN viewing my profile THEN the system SHALL display my plant collection statistics
4. WHEN a user wants to delete their account THEN the system SHALL provide a confirmation process and remove all user data

### Plant Collection

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save identified plants to my collection, so that I can build a personal plant library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plant is identified THEN the system SHALL provide an option to save it to the user's collection
2. WHEN a plant is saved THEN the system SHALL organize it in the user's collection with timestamp and location (if permitted)
3. WHEN viewing the collection THEN the system SHALL display plants in a grid with search and filter options
4. WHEN selecting a plant in the collection THEN the system SHALL display detailed information and the original photo

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each file should have a single, well-defined purpose
- **Modular Design**: Components, utilities, and services should be isolated and reusable
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize interdependencies between modules
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between components and layers
- **File Size Limits**: Keep files under 500 lines for AI compatibility

### Performance
- The camera interface should initialize within 2 seconds
- Plant identification should complete within 5 seconds (excluding network latency)
- The application should maintain 60fps scrolling performance in the plant collection
- The application should function with reasonable performance on devices up to 3 years old

### Security
- User authentication should follow OAuth 2.0 standards
- All API communications should use HTTPS with certificate pinning
- User data should be encrypted at rest
- The application should not store sensitive information in local storage without encryption

### Reliability
- The application should function in offline mode for viewing previously saved plants
- Failed API requests should implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- The application should gracefully handle and recover from crashes
- Regular automated backups of user data should be implemented

### Usability
- The interface should follow the design principles outlined in the product vision
- The application should support accessibility features (screen readers, contrast settings)
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- The camera interface should provide guidance for optimal plant photography
