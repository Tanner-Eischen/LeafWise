# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resolution of Flutter analyze errors, warnings, and informational issues in the LeafWise mobile application. The Flutter analyzer has identified 636 issues across the codebase that need to be resolved to improve code quality, maintainability, and ensure production readiness. These issues range from critical errors that prevent compilation to code quality improvements and deprecated API usage.

## Alignment with Product Vision

Resolving Flutter analyze issues directly supports the product vision by:
- Ensuring code reliability and stability for users
- Improving developer productivity through cleaner, more maintainable code
- Reducing technical debt that could impact future feature development
- Following Flutter best practices for a production-ready AI-enhanced plant care application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Critical Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all critical compilation errors resolved, so that the application can build and run successfully without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `flutter analyze` THEN the system SHALL report zero critical errors
2. IF there are static access to instance member errors THEN the system SHALL convert them to proper instance access
3. WHEN there are undefined identifier errors THEN the system SHALL add proper imports or fix naming issues
4. IF there are type mismatch errors THEN the system SHALL align return types with expected types
5. WHEN there are missing class/function errors THEN the system SHALL implement or import the required components

### Requirement 2: Deprecated API Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all deprecated API usage updated to current Flutter standards, so that the application remains compatible with future Flutter versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deprecated `withOpacity` is used THEN the system SHALL replace it with `withValues()` method
2. IF deprecated APIs are found THEN the system SHALL update to the recommended modern alternatives
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual and functional behavior

### Requirement 3: Code Quality Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused code elements removed and code quality warnings resolved, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unused variables are detected THEN the system SHALL remove them or mark them as intentionally unused
2. IF unused imports exist THEN the system SHALL remove the unnecessary import statements
3. WHEN unused methods or fields are found THEN the system SHALL either remove them or document their intended use
4. IF override warnings exist THEN the system SHALL fix incorrect override annotations

### Requirement 4: Async Context Safety

**User Story:** As a developer, I want BuildContext usage across async gaps to be safe, so that the application doesn't crash due to context issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN BuildContext is used across async gaps THEN the system SHALL implement proper context checking
2. IF mounted checks are needed THEN the system SHALL add appropriate widget lifecycle validation
3. WHEN async operations complete THEN the system SHALL verify context validity before usage

### Requirement 5: Test File Corrections

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files to compile and run without errors, so that the test suite can validate application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test files have import errors THEN the system SHALL add correct import statements
2. IF test providers are undefined THEN the system SHALL implement or mock the required providers
3. WHEN test classes are missing THEN the system SHALL create or import the necessary test utilities
4. IF ProviderScope is undefined in tests THEN the system SHALL add proper Riverpod test setup

### Requirement 6: Production Code Standards

**User Story:** As a developer, I want production code to follow Flutter best practices, so that the application meets professional development standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN print statements exist in production code THEN the system SHALL replace them with proper logging
2. IF debug-only code exists in production paths THEN the system SHALL implement conditional compilation
3. WHEN linting rules are violated THEN the system SHALL conform to Flutter/Dart style guidelines

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each fix should address one specific type of issue without introducing side effects
- **Modular Design**: Fixes should maintain existing component isolation and reusability
- **Dependency Management**: Import fixes should not create circular dependencies
- **Clear Interfaces**: Type fixes should maintain clean contracts between components

### Performance
- Code fixes must not introduce performance regressions
- Deprecated API migrations should maintain or improve performance
- Unused code removal should reduce bundle size

### Security
- Print statement removal should not expose sensitive information through alternative logging
- Context safety fixes should prevent potential security vulnerabilities from UI state corruption

### Reliability
- All fixes must maintain existing functionality
- Error handling should be preserved or improved
- Test coverage should be maintained after test file fixes

### Usability
- UI behavior must remain consistent after deprecated API migrations
- User experience should not be affected by code quality improvements
- Application startup and runtime performance should be maintained or improved
