## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

LeafWise follows a modular, service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Mobile Client Layer**
   - React Native application with modular feature organization
   - Offline-first data management with synchronization
   - Camera and image processing optimized for plant photography

2. **API Gateway Layer**
   - RESTful API endpoints for core functionality
   - WebSocket connections for real-time features
   - Authentication and authorization middleware

3. **Service Layer**
   - User service (profiles, authentication, preferences)
   - Plant service (identification, collection management)
   - Social service (posts, comments, following)
   - Notification service (push notifications, reminders)

4. **AI/ML Layer**
   - Plant identification processing
   - RAG engine for personalized recommendations
   - Health analysis model for disease detection

5. **Data Layer**
   - Relational database for structured data
   - Vector database for semantic search
   - Object storage for images and media
   - Cache for performance optimization

### Data Flow Architecture

#### Plant Identification Flow
1. User captures image in mobile app
2. Image is preprocessed on device (cropping, enhancement)
3. Image sent to API gateway with metadata
4. Plant service routes to identification service
5. Results returned with confidence scores
6. User confirms identification
7. Plant added to user's collection

#### RAG Recommendation Flow
1. User requests care advice for specific plant
2. Request includes context (location, experience level, etc.)
3. RAG service retrieves relevant knowledge chunks
4. LLM generates personalized recommendation
5. Response cached for similar future requests
6. Feedback collected to improve recommendations

## Technical Decisions

### React Native New Architecture

**Decision**: Adopt React Native 0.79+ with New Architecture

**Rationale**:
- Improved performance with Fabric renderer
- Better native module integration with TurboModules
- Future-proof for upcoming React Native improvements
- Enhanced camera performance for plant photography

**Considerations**:
- Higher learning curve for development team
- Potential compatibility issues with some libraries
- Migration path for future updates

### AI Implementation Strategy

**Decision**: Hybrid approach with third-party API for identification and custom RAG for recommendations

**Rationale**:
- Faster time-to-market using established identification API
- Better personalization with custom RAG implementation
- Reduced initial ML infrastructure costs
- Path to migrate to fully custom solution in future phases

**Considerations**:
- API usage costs at scale
- Data privacy with third-party services
- Integration complexity between systems

### Database Selection

**Decision**: PostgreSQL + Vector DB (Pinecone/Milvus)

**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL provides robust relational data storage
- Vector DB optimized for semantic search in RAG
- Proven scalability for social application patterns
- Strong ecosystem and tooling support

**Considerations**:
- Operational complexity of multiple databases
- Data synchronization between systems
- Cost implications at scale

## Performance Considerations

### Mobile Performance

- **Image Optimization**: Client-side processing to reduce upload size
- **Offline Support**: Core features available without connection
- **Lazy Loading**: On-demand content loading for social feeds
- **Memory Management**: Efficient image caching and recycling

### API Performance

- **Pagination**: All list endpoints support cursor-based pagination
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis caching for frequent queries
- **Rate Limiting**: Tiered rate limits to prevent abuse
- **Compression**: Response compression for bandwidth optimization

### AI Performance

- **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests when possible
- **Model Optimization**: Quantized models for mobile inference
- **Caching**: Cache common identification results
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking operations for intensive tasks

## Security Approach

### Authentication & Authorization

- **OAuth 2.0**: Social and email authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Short-lived access tokens with refresh mechanism
- **Role-Based Access**: Granular permissions system
- **Device Management**: Multiple device support with revocation

### Data Protection

- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **PII Handling**: Strict policies for personal information
- **Image Privacy**: User-controlled sharing permissions
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data export and deletion capabilities

### API Security

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation
- **OWASP Protection**: Guards against common vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force and DoS
- **Audit Logging**: Security events tracked for analysis

## Scalability Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Stateless Services**: All services designed for horizontal scaling
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across service instances
- **Database Sharding**: Prepare for data partitioning at scale
- **Microservices Evolution**: Path to break down monolith as needed

### Resource Optimization

- **Serverless Functions**: Use for bursty, stateless operations
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
- **CDN Integration**: Offload static content and images
- **Edge Computing**: Push computation closer to users when possible

## Testing Strategy

### Test Levels

- **Unit Testing**: 80%+ coverage for business logic
- **Integration Testing**: API endpoint validation
- **E2E Testing**: Critical user flows on actual devices
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing for key services

### AI Testing

- **Accuracy Validation**: Benchmark against known datasets
- **Bias Testing**: Ensure fair results across plant varieties
- **Performance Profiling**: Response time and resource usage
- **A/B Testing**: Compare recommendation algorithms

## Monitoring & Observability

- **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates, user actions
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, network utilization
- **Custom Dashboards**: Real-time visibility into system health
- **Alerting**: Proactive notification of potential issues
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request visualization
