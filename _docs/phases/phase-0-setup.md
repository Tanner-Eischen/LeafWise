# Phase 0: Project Setup & Foundation

**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Goal**: Establish a barebones but functional project foundation with basic structure and minimal features

---

## Phase Overview

This phase creates the fundamental project structure and implements the most basic functionality to ensure the development environment is properly configured and the core architecture is in place. The result will be a minimal but running application that demonstrates the basic tech stack integration.
