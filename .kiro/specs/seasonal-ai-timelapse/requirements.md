# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement adds advanced seasonal AI predictions and automated time-lapse growth tracking to the Plant Social platform. The enhancement transforms the app from reactive plant care to predictive, seasonal-aware plant management with automated visual documentation of plant growth over time.

The seasonal AI system will analyze environmental data, plant species characteristics, and historical patterns to provide predictive insights about plant behavior across seasons. The time-lapse system will automatically capture and compile plant growth progression, creating engaging visual stories while providing valuable data for health analysis.

6. WHEN users plan plant purchases THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal timing based on seasonal predictions

### Requirement 2: Environmental Data Integration

**User Story:** As a plant owner, I want the app to understand my local climate and seasonal patterns, so that predictions are accurate for my specific location and conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets their location THEN the system SHALL integrate local weather data and seasonal patterns
2. WHEN seasonal weather patterns change THEN the system SHALL adjust plant care predictions accordingly
3. WHEN extreme weather is predicted THEN the system SHALL provide plant protection recommendations
4. IF indoor conditions differ from outdoor climate THEN the system SHALL account for microclimate variations
5. WHEN daylight hours change seasonally THEN the system SHALL adjust light-related care recommendations

### Requirement 3: Automated Time-lapse Growth Tracking

**User Story:** As a plant parent, I want automated time-lapse documentation of my plant's growth, so that I can visually track progress and share growth stories with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables time-lapse tracking THEN the system SHALL prompt for regular photo captures at optimal intervals
2. WHEN sufficient photos are collected THEN the system SHALL automatically generate time-lapse videos
3. WHEN growth milestones are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight significant changes in the time-lapse
4. IF growth appears stunted or unhealthy THEN the system SHALL flag concerning patterns in the visual timeline
5. WHEN time-lapse videos are complete THEN users SHALL be able to share them as plant stories
6. WHEN viewing time-lapse data THEN the system SHALL overlay growth metrics and care events

### Requirement 4: AR Seasonal Visualization

**User Story:** As a plant enthusiast, I want AR overlays that show seasonal predictions and growth projections, so that I can visualize future plant states and plan accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using AR camera mode THEN the system SHALL overlay seasonal prediction data on live plant view
2. WHEN seasonal changes are predicted THEN AR SHALL show visual representations of expected plant changes
3. WHEN growth tracking is active THEN AR SHALL display projected growth patterns over time
4. IF seasonal stress is predicted THEN AR SHALL highlight areas of concern with visual indicators
5. WHEN planning plant arrangements THEN AR SHALL show seasonal size and appearance changes
6. WHEN educational mode is active THEN AR SHALL display seasonal care tips contextually

### Requirement 5: Predictive Care Scheduling

**User Story:** As a busy plant owner, I want AI to automatically adjust my care schedule based on seasonal predictions, so that my plants receive optimal care without constant manual adjustments.

2. WHEN growth phases are predicted THEN the system SHALL adjust fertilization recommendations
3. WHEN dormancy periods approach THEN the system SHALL modify care routines accordingly
4. IF seasonal pests are likely THEN the system SHALL schedule preventive treatments
5. WHEN repotting seasons arrive THEN the system SHALL recommend optimal timing for plant species
6. WHEN seasonal propagation opportunities occur THEN the system SHALL suggest propagation activities

### Requirement 6: Growth Analytics and Insights

**User Story:** As a plant collector, I want detailed analytics about my plants' growth patterns and seasonal responses, so that I can optimize my plant care expertise and share insights with the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing plant analytics THEN the system SHALL display growth rate trends over time
2. WHEN seasonal patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL identify and highlight recurring behaviors
3. WHEN comparing plants THEN the system SHALL show relative growth performance and seasonal responses
4. IF growth anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic insights
5. WHEN sharing with community THEN users SHALL be able to export growth data and time-lapse content
6. WHEN learning from community THEN the system SHALL incorporate successful seasonal care patterns from other users

### Requirement 7: Community Seasonal Challenges
