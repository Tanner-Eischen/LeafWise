# Critical Fixes Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the critical blocking issues preventing the Plant Social application from being usable. The application has extensive features but suffers from several critical problems including Pydantic model recursion errors, FastAPI response model issues, missing dependencies, and configuration problems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Backend Critical Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to start without errors, so that I can develop and test the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend application starts THEN it SHALL load all modules without import errors
2. WHEN Pydantic models are instantiated THEN they SHALL NOT cause recursion errors
3. WHEN FastAPI endpoints are registered THEN they SHALL have valid response model configurations
4. IF circular references exist in models THEN they SHALL be resolved using proper forward references
5. WHEN missing service dependencies are imported THEN they SHALL exist and be properly implemented

### Requirement 2: Database and Migration Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the database schema to be properly set up, so that the application can store and retrieve data correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database migrations are run THEN they SHALL execute without errors
2. WHEN SQLAlchemy models are defined THEN they SHALL NOT use reserved attribute names
3. WHEN the application connects to the database THEN it SHALL establish connections successfully
4. IF migration conflicts exist THEN they SHALL be resolved with proper migration ordering

### Requirement 3: Environment and Configuration Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration, so that external services can be integrated correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load environment variables from .env file
2. WHEN external API services are called THEN they SHALL have proper API keys configured
3. WHEN optional services are unavailable THEN the application SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
4. IF required environment variables are missing THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4: API Endpoint Stabilization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want stable API endpoints, so that I can integrate frontend features with the backend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL return proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN response models are defined THEN they SHALL be valid Pydantic models
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN endpoints SHALL properly validate user tokens
4. IF endpoint dependencies are missing THEN they SHALL be implemented or stubbed appropriately

### Requirement 5: Frontend Compatibility Fixes

**User Story:** As a user, I want the mobile application to run without warnings, so that I have a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Flutter app is built THEN it SHALL compile without critical errors
2. WHEN deprecated APIs are used THEN they SHALL be updated to current Flutter standards
3. WHEN unused code exists THEN it SHALL be removed or properly utilized
4. IF API integrations fail THEN the frontend SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 6: Service Integration and Stubs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all service dependencies to be available, so that the application modules can be imported and tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are imported THEN they SHALL exist and be properly implemented
2. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN stub implementations SHALL provide basic functionality
3. WHEN service methods are called THEN they SHALL return appropriate data structures
4. IF complex ML features are not ready THEN they SHALL have placeholder implementations

### Requirement 7: Basic Functionality Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want core application features to work, so that I can use the plant care platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN they SHALL be able to create an account successfully
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN they SHALL receive proper authentication tokens
3. WHEN plant identification is requested THEN it SHALL return results or appropriate errors
4. WHEN basic CRUD operations are performed THEN they SHALL work with the database
5. IF advanced features fail THEN core functionality SHALL remain operational
